ðŸŒŒ 2D Solar System Simulation (C++)
A simple 2D solar system simulation built using C++ and basic graphics libraries. This project visualizes the sun and orbiting planets with animated circular motion to illustrate basic planetary mechanics. Itâ€™s a great introduction to 2D graphics, transformations, and animation principles.

ðŸš€ Features
Simulated orbits of planets around the sun

Proportional distances and sizes (simplified)

Real-time animation using graphics.h or similar library

Clean and structured code for easy understanding

ðŸ›  Technologies
Language: C++

Graphics Library: graphics.h (or alternative like SDL/OpenGL)

Concepts: 2D transformation, loops, trigonometry, animation
